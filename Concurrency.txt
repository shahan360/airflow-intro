Concurrency, the parameters you must know!
Concurrency, the parameters you must know!
Airflow has several parameters to tune your tasks and DAGs concurrency.

Concurrency defines the number of tasks and DAG Runs that you can execute at the same time (in parallel)



Starting from the configuration settings

parallelism / AIRFLOW__CORE__PARALELISM

This defines the maximum number of task instances that can run in Airflow per scheduler. By default, you can execute up to 32 tasks at the same time. If you have 2 schedulers: 2 x 32 = 64 tasks.

What value to define here depends on the resources you have and the number of schedulers running.



max_active_tasks_per_dag / AIRFLOW__CORE__MAX_ACTIVE_TASKS_PER_DAG

This defines the maximum number of task instances allowed to run concurrently in each DAG. By default, you can execute up to 16 tasks at the same time for a given DAG across all DAG Runs.



max_active_runs_per_dag / AIRFLOW__CORE__MAX_ACTIVE_RUNS_PER_DAG

This defines the maximum number of active DAG runs per DAG. By default, you can have up to 16 DAG runs per DAG running at the same time.
